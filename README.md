# Lead Scoring Case Study
## Problem Statement

An education company called X Education sells its online courses to industry professionals through various channels. Many professionals land on their website and browse for courses and fill the enquiry form on their website after which the company classifies that individual as a lead. Once these leads are acquired, the sales team starts following up with the individuals. Through this process, some of the leads get converted to a tune of around 30%. The company wants to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’ for improving the lead conversion rate and generate more revenue.

## Business Objective

The company X Education wants us to build a model to give every lead a lead score between 0 -100 so that they can identify the potential ‘Hot Leads’ and increase their conversion rate. The CEO wants to achieve a lead conversion rate of around 80%. The model needs to be resilient to handle any future possible constraints as well and accordingly have built-in contingency.
